The museum was founded in 1895 by the Pittsburgh-based industrialist Andrew Carnegie.[1][self-published source?] It was the first museum in the United States with a primary focus on contemporary art.[2] As instructed by its founder at the inception of the Carnegie International in 1896, the museum has been organizing many contemporary exhibitions that showcase the ""Old Masters of tomorrow"".[3]"	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museum_of_Art
1	1	The Andy Warhol Museum	The Andy Warhol Museum is located on the North Shore of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is the largest museum in North America dedicated to a single artist.[4]  The museum holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives from the Pittsburgh-born pop art icon Andy Warhol.The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and is a collaborative project of the Carnegie Institute, the Dia Art Foundation and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWFVA).[5]The museum is located in an 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) facility on seven floors.  Containing 17 galleries, the museum features 900 paintings, close to 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and over 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Its most recent operating budget (2010) was $6.1 million.  In addition to its Pittsburgh location the museum has sponsored 56 traveling exhibits that have attracted close to nine million visitors in 153 venues worldwide since 1996.[6]	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andy_Warhol_Museum
2	2	Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens	"Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens is a botanical garden set in Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a City of Pittsburgh historic landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[4]The gardens were founded in 1893 by steel and real-estate magnate Henry Phipps as a gift to the City of Pittsburgh. Its purpose is to educate and entertain the people of Pittsburgh with formal gardens (Roman, English, etc.) and various species of exotic plants (palm trees, succulents, bonsai, orchids, etc.). Currently, the facilities house elaborate gardens within the fourteen room conservatory itself and on the adjoining grounds. In addition to its primary flora exhibits, the sophisticated glass and metalwork of the Lord & Burnham conservatory offers an interesting example of Victorian greenhouse architecture.Phipps is one of the ""greenest"" facilities in the world.[5] The entrance pavilion of the Phipps Conservatory has silver-level LEED certification.[6] Its greenhouse production facility has received Platinum certification,  the first and only greenhouse to be so certified.[7] Moreover, the Center for Sustainable Landscapes, designed to be as environmentally sustainable as possible, is also LEED Platinum certified, and produces all of its own energy."	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phipps_Conservatory_and_Botanical_Gardens

Located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Highland Park, the zoo sits on 77 acres (31 ha) of park land where it exhibits more than 4,000 animals representing 475 species, including 20 threatened or endangered species.The zoo's accredited membership of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) was dropped in 2015.[1]History[edit]The Pittsburgh Zoo opened on June 14, 1898, as Highland Park Zoo,[2] after Christopher Lyman Magee donated $125,000 (about four million dollars when adjusted for inflation)[3] for the construction of a zoological garden in Pittsburgh's Highland Park.  Like most other zoos of the time, the Pittsburgh Zoo more closely resembled a menagerie than an actual zoo.  However, as time progressed, the animal exhibits eventually became more naturalistic, and the zoo's goal became more focused on conservation.In 1937, the bear exhibits were built under the Works Progress Administration.  These exhibits were the zoo's first attempt at constructing more naturalistic exhibits instead of simply displaying animals in cages.  In 1949, the Children's Zoo opened with a grant from the Sarah Mellon Scaife Foundation.  The Children's Zoo contained interactive exhibits and play areas for children, including a simulated large chunk of cheese that was inhabited by dozens of live mice.  In 1967, the AquaZoo, a large aquarium, opened to the public.  At the time of its completion, the AquaZoo was the only aquarium in Pennsylvania and the second largest aquarium in the United States.In 1980, the zoo's Master Plan was put into effect.  This plan called for extensive renovations and the construction of more naturalistic exhibits.  The Asian Forest, which opened in 1983, was the first area of the zoo that utilized this new philosophy of naturalistic exhibits.  The African Savanna was the next area to obtain naturalistic exhibits when it was completed in 1987. 1991 marked the opening of the Tropical Forest, a five-acre indoor rain forest showcasing about 16 species of primate and 150 tropical plant species.  That same year, the Children's Zoo was renovated and renamed the Children's Farm. Three petting zoos were built in Children's Farm where children could pet kangaroos, deer, and domesticated animals such as sheep and goats.In 1994, the Pittsburgh Zoo became a private nonprofit organization, still owned by the City of Pittsburgh, but managed and operated by the Zoological Society of Pittsburgh.  That same year, the Education Complex was built.  This new building contained five classrooms, a library, and a 300-seat lecture hall.  The construction of this building was an important part of the zoo's history because it signified the zoo's dedication to conservation and education.  In 2000, the AquaZoo underwent a $17.4 million renovation, and was renamed the PPG Aquarium.  This new aquarium is twice the size of the original AquaZoo.  In 2002, the Education Complex was expanded to include a second story, providing more classrooms, teacher resource areas, and an animal holding area.  This expansion was made possible by the Scaife Charitable Foundation and by donations from senator Rick Santorum.On November 19, 2002, elephant keeper Mike Gatti was killed by one of the zoo's elephants.[4] Gatti, 46, was killed while attempting to encourage the elephant to move to a different part of her enclosure.[4] She butted him with her head, crushing him against the ground and killing him instantly.[4] This was the first instance of a human fatality at the zoo, although there had been injuries.[4]In 2006, the Pittsburgh Zoo completed Water's Edge, a marine exhibit that allows guests to have close encounters with polar bears, sea otters, and sand tiger sharks.[5]On November 4, 2012, a two-year-old boy, Maddox Derkosh, who had been sitting on the railing of the African wild dog exhibit, fell off the railing, bounced off protective netting, and fell into the enclosure, resulting in his death. The medical examiner subsequently determined that Maddox was killed by the 11 dogs that attacked him, not by the fall. Zookeepers immediately rushed to the area, firing darts to try and scare the dogs off, and police shot one particularly aggressive dog, which had refused to retreat from the exhibit when called. The other dogs were quarantined for thirty days but there were no plans to put them down.[6][7][8] The prosecutor, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania District Attorney Stephen Zappala, calling the incident a ""tragic accident"", has stated he will not charge Maddox's mother, Elizabeth Derkosh, 34, who had lifted the visually impaired boy up on top of the railing to get a better view. He is still investigating whether the zoo is at fault due to any possible negligence.[9] Since the incident, the zoo replaced the wild dogs with cheetahs. As a result of his death, Trucks for Maddox was created, to donate Maddox's toy trucks to children. It was also the second human fatality at the zoo.Exhibits[edit]The Pittsburgh Zoo is divided into eight sections, each of which focuses on a particular theme.Kid's Kingdom[edit]Kid's Kingdom opened in 1949, when it was then simply called Children's Zoo. In 1994 a naming contest was implemented for a new name to the newly expanded area, the name was from winner Adam Mellinger from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.  This section of the zoo is an interactive children's area, and contains a petting zoo stocked with domesticated animals;[5] a reptile house; a playground; and several exhibits featuring wildlife from Pennsylvania, including white-tailed deer, beavers, and river otters including a sea lion exhibit.[10]Kid's Kingdom contains many interactive exhibits, such as the meerkat exhibit, which contains crawl-through tunnels that gives the viewer an idea of what it is like to be a meerkat or other burrowing animal[11]  as well as a walk-through kangaroo pen. The animal yards and habitats in Kids Kingdom allow visitors to learn about animals' lives, behaviors, and points-of-view. Kid's Kingdom has been highly ranked by both Parent Magazine and America's Best Zoos Travel Guide.[12]PPG Aquarium[edit]Built in 1967 (then called AquaZoo) and renovated in 2000,[5] the PPG Aquarium is a 45,000 square foot, two-story aquarium that presents several aquatic habitats.  The aquarium's theme is the ""Diversity of Water"", and contains several exhibits that portray different marine ecosystems, including a tropical rainforest inhabited by arapaima and piranha; a Pennsylvania exhibit, which features fish and aquatic wildlife of the Allegheny River, such as the brook trout; a penguin exhibit, which is inhabited by kings, macaronis, and gentoos; a coral reef; and an open ocean exhibit.[13]The aquarium used to contain river dolphins. When the AquaZoo opened in October 1967, it included a baby river dolphin named Pinky. However, Pinky died twelve days after its opening from an eye infection. In 1970, seven river dolphins arrived, but however in 1972, three dolphins died from emergency digestive surgery. One of the river dolphins who had arrived in 1970, Chuckles, survived. Chuckles became the longest-living river dolphin kept in captivity, and by the 1980s, became the only river dolphin kept in captivity at North America. He performed tricks, interacted with visitors, and his trainers would swim with him occasionally. When the aquarium was renovated in 2000, Chuckles was transferred to a customized pool five times the size of his previous home. He died at the elderly age of 34 years old on February 20, 2002. A portrait commemorating him can be found at the PPG Aquarium.[14]Forest Passage[edit]Forest Passage (formerly Asian Forest) contains several species from Eastern and Southeast Asia, and simulates a journey from the Himalayas to Indonesia.  This section features some of the most critically endangered big cats of Asia, including Amur leopards, and Siberian tigers, as well as several other Asian animals, such as Komodo dragons,[15] snow leopards, and red pandas. This section, opened in 1983, is the result of the zoo's Master Plan of 1980, which was dedicated to create more naturalistic exhibits than what existed at the time.[5]In January 2017, the Pittsburgh Zoo's only snow leopard, Chaney, died of cancer at 17. Since then, the zoo has displayed two Canada lynx in the snow leopard exhibit. In late 2018, several cubs were born to the pair, resulting in a larger family of Lynx. This change has prompted the zoo to rename Asian Forest to Forest Passage in light of the inclusion of a non-Asian animal species.Tropical Forest[edit]The Tropical Forest, which opened in 1991, is a 0.5-acre indoor rainforest.  This building focuses mostly on primates, containing 16 species in total. Ring-tailed lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, tufted capuchins, white-faced sakis, black howler monkeys, white-cheeked gibbons, Angola colobuses, blue monkeys, and great apes, including gorillas and orangutans all live in this building.[5] Several other types of rainforest animals are displayed here as well, such as Hoffman's two-toed sloths and Solomon Island leaf frogs.[16]African Savanna[edit]Like the Asian Forest, the African Savanna is also a result of the zoo's Master Plan of 1980.[5]  Completed in 1987, this section of the zoo is modeled to give the viewer the impression that he or she is walking along a river in an African savanna.  This section of the zoo contains lions, African bush elephants, giraffes, plains zebras, black rhinos, flamingos, ostrich, dama gazelle, and nyala.Cheetah Valley is part of the African Savanna. It originally exhibited the African wild dogs and known as Painted Dog Encounter and African Painted Dog Bush Camp, but they were removed because of the incident on November 4, 2012 in order to ensure the safety of the visitors. This exhibit now features cheetahs. Visitors can view them from a glass panel. The former observation platform was permanently replaced by tall protective welded fences and shrubbery.[17]Bears[edit]The three bear exhibits were built in 1937 under the Works Progress Administration program, and are the oldest exhibits in the zoo.[5]  Three bear species were displayed here: American black bears, spectacled bears, and a Kodiak bear.[18]In August 2010, the Pittsburgh Zoo announced that their 28-year-old Kodiak bear, Rocky, died.  Rocky was suffering from severe arthritis in the joints between his vertebrae, causing severe pain and limited mobility.  Although the veterinary staff attempted to alleviate Rocky's pain, his quality of life continued to rapidly decline, and he had to be humanely euthanized.  As of August 2010, his exhibit is empty.[19]The bear exhibits are currently empty. Plans exist to construct new bear exhibits, while the old ones are being used as part of zoo expansion and construction.[20]Water's Edge[edit]Completed in 2006, Water's Edge is a newer section of the zoo, and is located adjacent to the PPG aquarium.  This section is constructed to resemble a coastal fishing village, and illustrates the ways that humans interact with marine wildlife in coastal areas.  A long walk-through tunnel runs through three large water tanks containing polar bears, sea otters, two northern elephant seals, two California sea lions, and formerly sand tiger sharks.[21]According to Barbara Baker, the shark/elephant seal exhibit was originally intended for walruses, but walruses are difficult to obtain.  The elephant seal, named ""Coolio"", who was taken in early in 2014 replaced the sand tiger sharks in 2017 as a resident of Water's Edge. As of 2020, two rescued females have also been brought in. Coolio died in December 2019.[22][23] The sand tiger sharks were moved to Florida in the process.The Islands[edit]Opened in June 2015, The Islands exhibit is a 22,000 square foot exhibit featuring several endangered animals including two Philippine crocodiles, Aldabra giant tortoises, Visayan warty pigs, clouded leopards and a playful pair of Siamangs and their baby. The exhibit has scenery intended to provide the atmosphere of a tropical island, and includes a large area of sand with beach chairs and umbrellas.Jungle Odyssey[edit]Opened in June 2017, Jungle Odyssey is an expansion directly behind The Islands. The area displays rainforest animal species from rainforests around the world like Africa, Asia, and South America, featuring a mixed species exhibit housing capybaras and giant anteaters, as well as exhibits for ocelots, fossa, and a pygmy hippo.Breeding[edit]On September 12, 1999, one of the zoo's female African elephants, Moja, successfully gave birth to a female calf, later named Victoria. This was a major feat for the zoo, because Victoria was the first African elephant to be born and survive in North America since 1982. Also, she was the first to be born to a captive-born mother. A second calf, a male named Callee, was born to another female named Savannah almost exactly one year later on September 19, 2000. The father of both of these calves is a bull named Jackson, who is currently the only male African breeding naturally in North America. Both Moja and Savannah became pregnant again in 2006. On July 9, 2008, Savannah gave birth to a female calf named Angelina. Moja gave birth to a female as well on July 25, 2008. This calf has been named Zuri.On August 8, 2006, the zoo's female Amur tiger, Toma, gave birth to a litter of three cubs. This is also a major accomplishment because Amurs are endangered, and every successful litter counts a great deal. Although one of the cubs died of a heart defect in September (a female named Nadya), the other two are healthy and doing well. The surviving cubs are a male named Petya and a female named Mara.Another Amur tiger cub was born to Toma on May 11, 2008. The male cub, Grom (name meaning Thunder for he was born during a thunderstorm), had been taken from his mother because Toma was not being very attentive to him. Handlers later determined that it is most likely because Toma is not producing enough milk, if any at all. On September 12, 2008, the baby cub was named after Billy Ray Cyrus, the country music and television star. Zoo representatives said the donors who paid to name the cub ""Billy Ray"" wanted to honor a late family member who was a big Cyrus fan. Billy Ray will likely grow up to be about 11 feet long and weigh 450 pounds, according to the zoo.In 2010, three cubs were again born to Toma, and to Taiga their father. All three are doing very well at the zoo. Toma is caring for all three.On June 13, 2009, a baby sea lion was born. Other recent births include two North American river otters and a pair of baby beavers.On October 25, 2009, one of the zoo's African painted dogs, Vega, gave birth to a litter of nine live puppies, and one dead puppy.  Vega died the next day, leaving her puppies orphaned.  To help nurse and raise the dogs, the zoo found a domesticated dog, Honey, from a local shelter who had recently given birth and was still lactating.  Honey immediately took to the puppies and fed them.  At the same time, the zoo's vet staff hand-fed the puppies a liquid diet fortified with enzymes. Although, four of the remaining puppies died – the typical mortality rate for African painted dogs is 50 percent – the remaining five were healthy and doing well after a month.[24]  The painted dogs were involved in the death of a young boy in November 2012, during which one dog was shot, and the exhibit was closed.[25]  The painted dogs left the zoo in 2013 and are moved to other zoos.[26]References[edit]^ ""Pittsburgh zoo drops accreditation due to disagreement over elephant handling"".

4	4	Kennywood	Kennywood is an amusement park located in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, just southeast of Pittsburgh. The park opened on May 30, 1899, as a trolley park attraction at the end of the Mellon family's Monongahela Street Railway.[1][2] It was purchased in 1906 by F. W. Henninger and Andrew McSwigan, both of whom later formed the family-owned Kennywood Entertainment Company. The company later sold Kennywood, along with four other parks, in 2007 to Parques Reunidos, an international entertainment operator based in Spain.[6] The amusement park features various structures and rides dating back to the early 1900s. Along with Rye Playland Park, it is one of two amusement parks in the United States designated as a National Historic Landmark. Kennywood is also one of thirteen trolley parks in the United States that remain in operation.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennywood

Pittsburgh settled on the current design after rejecting an alternative plan for a Point Park Civic Center designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.The park also includes the outlines and remains of two of the oldest structures in Pittsburgh, Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne. The Fort Pitt Museum, housed in the Monongahela Bastion of Fort Pitt, commemorates the French and Indian War (1754–63), in which the area soon to become Pittsburgh was a major battlefield.  It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for its role in the strategic struggles between Native Americans, French colonists, and British colonists, for control of the Ohio River watershed.[5]	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_State_Park

9	9	Duquesne Incline	The Duquesne Incline (/duːˈkeɪn/) is a funicular located near Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood and scaling Mt. Washington in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Designed by Hungarian-American engineer Samuel Diescher, the incline was completed in 1877.The lower station is in the Second Empire style. Together with the incline, which rises 400 feet (122 m) in height, at a 30-degree angle, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The incline is unusual for having a track gauge standard used only in Finland, Russia, and Mongolia.Together with the Monongahela Incline, it is one of two passenger inclines still in operation on Pittsburgh's South Side. By 1977, the two had become tourist attractions and together served more than one million commuters and tourists annually.[3] That year both inclines were designated as Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duquesne_Incline
10	10	PNC Park	"PNC Park is a Major League Baseball (MLB) stadium located on the North Shore of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates of MLB.[8][9] It was opened during the 2001 MLB season, after the controlled implosion of the Pirates' previous home, Three Rivers Stadium. PNC Park stands just east of its predecessor along the Allegheny River with a view of the Downtown Pittsburgh skyline. Constructed of steel and limestone, PNC Park features a natural grass playing surface and has a seating capacity of 38,747 people for baseball.Plans to build a new stadium for the Pirates originated in 1991 but did not come to fruition for five years. Funded in conjunction with Acrisure Stadium and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the park was constructed for $216 million over 24 months, faster than most modern stadiums. Built in the ""retro-classic"" style modeled after past venues like Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of limestone in the building's facade.[8] The park also features a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and local eateries. Several tributes to former Pirate Roberto Clemente were incorporated into the ballpark, which included renaming the Sixth Street Bridge behind it in his honor. In addition to the Pirates' regular season and postseason home games, PNC Park has hosted other sporting events, including the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and numerous concerts.PNC Financial Services originally purchased the naming rights in 1998 for $30 million over 20 years.[10][11] Their current naming rights agreement runs through 2031.[12]Several writers have listed PNC Park as one of the best baseball stadiums in America, citing its location, views of the Pittsburgh skyline and Allegheny River, timeless design, and clear angles of the field from every seat.[13][14][15][16]"	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park

17	18	Fort Pitt Museum	Fort Pitt Museum is an indoor/outdoor museum that is administered by the Senator John Heinz History Center in downtown Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, where the Ohio River is formed. Fort Pitt Museum is surrounded by Point State Park, a Pennsylvania state park named for the geographically and historically significant point that is between the rivers. This piece of land was key to controlling the upper reaches of the Ohio River Valley and western Pennsylvania, before, during and after the French and Indian War as well as the American Revolution.The museum is in a recreated bastion of Fort Pitt, which was originally built in 1758 by the British. An outline of Fort Duquesne is nearby. The historical focus of the museum is the role that Fort Pitt played during the French and Indian War. The museum also features detailed information on Fort Pitt's role during the American Revolution, the Whiskey Rebellion and the founding of Pittsburgh. The museum was established and operated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until its closure in August 2009 from state budget cuts. The Heinz Center took over the operation of the museum and reopened it in April 2010.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pitt_Museum
18	19	Phantom's Revenge	Phantom's Revenge, formerly named Steel Phantom, is a steel roller coaster at Kennywood amusement park in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. When it opened as Steel Phantom in 1991, it featured the fastest speed and longest drop of any roller coaster in the world. It features a unique characteristic of having a second drop that is longer than its first. The ride was originally manufactured by Arrow Dynamics but was later modified and renovated by D.H. Morgan Manufacturing for the 2001 season, when it reopened as Phantom's Revenge. The drop and track length were both increased, and its four inversions were removed enabling the ride to remove its unpopular over-the-shoulder restraints.The ride has been ranked in the top 50 of the annual Golden Ticket Awards every year since 1998, spending a considerable amount of that time in the top 10. In addition, it has been ranked consistently in the top 5 of the National Amusement Park Historical Association Favorite Steel Roller Coaster poll, with the exception of the association's 2008 results.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom%27s_Revenge

20	21	Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum	"Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum (or often simply Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall) is a National Register of Historic Places landmark in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.  It is the largest memorial in the United States dedicated solely to honoring all branches of military veterans and service personnel.It was conceived by the Grand Army of the Republic in the 1890s as a way for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County to honor the dwindling ranks of its American Civil War veterans; it was built on what had served as the army mustering ground during the Civil War. The Memorial today represents all branches of the service and honors both career and citizen soldiers who have served the United States throughout its history.Architect Henry Hornbostel designed the memorial in 1907. Dedicated in 1910, the building is in the Beaux-Arts style and is heroic in scale. It is located in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh at 4141 Fifth Avenue (although the walkway leading to its main entrance is signed as ""Matthew Ridgway Blvd."" in honor of the World War II and Korean War hero who called Pittsburgh home) and adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh campus and its Cathedral of Learning. The building is set back from Fifth Avenue, featuring expansive and well-kept lawns dotted with large cannons and other war implements. Side streets flanking the building are Bigelow Boulevard and University Place; directly behind is O'Hara Street.The Memorial houses rare and one-of-a-kind exhibits that span the eras from the Civil War to the present day conflicts. Since 1963 it has operated the ""Hall of Valor"" to honor individual veterans from the region who went above and beyond the call of duty. Today the hall has over 600 honorees among them are Medal of Honor, The Kearny Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Cross winners.The building houses an auditorium seating 2,500, a banquet hall, and meeting rooms, in addition to its museum. The expansive lawn of the memorial sits on top of an underground parking garage operated under a long-term lease by the University of Pittsburgh.It has served as host for many city, civic, university, and business events including the April 25, 1978 Gulf Oil Corporation shareholders meeting.[4]"	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldiers_and_Sailors_Memorial_Hall_and_Museum

Riders are arranged 2 across in 3 rows for a total of 18 riders per train.Jack Rabbit at RCDBJack Rabbit is a wooden roller coaster located at Kennywood Park near Pittsburgh in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. Designed and built by John A. Miller[2] and Harry C. Baker,[3] Jack Rabbit opened in 1920, making it one of the oldest roller coasters in the world still in operation.[4] The ride's three trains were manufactured by Edward Vettel, Sr. in 1951 and contain three cars of six seats each.  The aging cars are considered a part of the ride's nostalgic experience but also lead to some young children being disallowed to enter the ride (42” is the minimum), due to the use of a small lap bar to hold in riders.  A popular early feature of the ride was a tunnel which covered the turnaround section after the first drop, but this was removed in 1947 when the new cars were ordered. In 1991, the tunnel was restored, at a slightly shorter length.The Jack Rabbit was built shortly after Miller patented a new track design in 1920 (which all wooden coasters built since have used). This design involved the use of wheels both under and over the track, which allowed Miller to create the then enormous 70-foot (21 m) drop that is the attraction's largest.  It is most well known for its double dip element following the lift hill. The double dip produces strong airtime that makes the rider feel that they will be thrown from the seat, and a feeling that the train leaves the track (it rises up but the upstop wheels keep it firmly on the rails).According to Rick Sebak, producer of Pittsburgh history programs for WQED, the layout and train design results in the rear seat of each train experiencing the greatest amount of airtime.[citation needed]In 2019, Kennywood released a video of the Jack Rabbit, likely from 1920, on their YouTube channel. The video features clips of people on the ride and clips taken from the front row seat of the Jack Rabbit. Kennywood claims their video is ""the oldest coaster POV video in the world"".[5]Awards[edit]The nonprofit organization American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) designated Jack Rabbit as a Coaster Classic.[6] The ACE also designated Jack Rabbit as an ""ACE Roller Coaster Landmark"" in June 2010.[7] It is also a contributing structure to the Kennywood Park historic district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[8]Golden Ticket Awards: Top wood Roller CoastersYear1998199920012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192022Ranking20[9]22[10]36[11]37[12]42[13]34[14]28[15]37[16]33[17]34[18]39[19]20[20]23[21]16[22]18[23]19[24]21[25]20[26]26[27]20[28]20[29]12[30]Gallery[edit]The orange train after departing the station.The pink train begins its descent down the double dip.

The Carrie Furnaces were built in 1884 and they operated until 1982. During its peak, the site produced 1,000 to 1,250 tons of iron per day.[3] All that is left of the site are furnaces #6 and #7, which operated from 1907 to 1978,[4] and its hot metal bridge (not to be confused with the Hot Metal Bridge farther downstream). The furnaces, designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006, are among the only pre-World War II 20th century blast furnaces to survive.[5]The site is currently managed by the nonprofit Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation, which conducts tours and other programs from May through October.

27	29	Mellon Park	"Mellon Park is a park in the Shadyside and Point Breeze neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, straddling both sides of Fifth Avenue, from approximately Shady Avenue to Penn Avenue, the western corner abutting Pittsburgh Center for the Arts building. The park is home to the Walled Garden, and holds events throughout the year. It is also home to several recreational facilities. A number of public buses serve the area.The park is on the list of landmarks recognized by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation (PHLF).Contents1 History2 The Walled Garden3 A Fair in the Park4 Mellon Park Tennis Center5 References6 External linksHistory[edit]The park was established in 1943, on the grounds of the former estate of Richard B. Mellon. His was the largest mansion in Pittsburgh. The mansion was built by Italian immigrants from New Kensington, PA under the direction of Monsignor Nicola Fusco. These industrious men then built the monumental Mount St. Peter Church in New Kensington which still stands and functions to this day from the materials of the Mellon Mansion.  The gardens were originally designed in 1912 by Alden and Harlow.  Several other architects added their own touch to the landscape including the Olmsted Brothers and some seventeen years after the garden began, Vitale and Geiffert.  After Mellon's sixty-room home was brought down during World War II, most of the garden still remained and was transformed into a city park known now as Mellon Park.  The park also contains the Phipps Garden Center and Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.[1]The Walled Garden[edit]The Walled Garden is surrounded by walls of brick and limestone and one of Gothic design.  The garden's fourth wall was part of the Mellon mansion before its demolition in the 1940s.  A fountain stands between the garden and the rest of the park. Vitale and Geiffert were behind the planning of this garden.  The Mellon Park Project wanted to create a memorial in memory of Ann Katherine Seamans, who frequented the Walled Garden repeatedly after being introduced to it in kindergarten. Janet Zweig, an artist chosen by the project team, turned the floor of the garden into an exact replica of the sky in Pittsburgh on the day Ann was born.[2]  There are 150 stars and each is a light in the ground and includes an inscription about it.  It is possible to sponsor a star and make a donation.[3]  LaQuatra Bonci Associates was responsible for the planning and supervising of the garden's redemption. The park was reopened on June 12, 2010.[4]A Fair in the Park[edit]Any form of event can potentially take place in Mellon Park by permission from the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works.[5]  One event that has taken place annually since 1969 is A Fair in the Park put on by the Craftsmen's Guild of Pittsburgh in the month of September.  This is a contemporary craft festival with a small concert.  There is an area just for children.  No admission fee is charged.[6]Mellon Park Tennis Center[edit]The Mellon Park Tennis Center is a year-round facility that offers classes for younger children ages 4–7 and other age groups up to adults.[7]  Along with the tennis courts Mellon Park includes a playground, basketball courts, and baseball fields.[8]References[edit]^ History.

The trail is promoted and maintained in part by the 'Friends of the Riverfront'.[2] Their stated mission is to increase awareness and engagement with the region's rivers and riverfronts through activities and stewardship, and to extend the water and land trails on the major rivers within Allegheny County.[citation needed]At the Pittsburgh Point State Park, there are three rivers: the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which unite to form the Ohio River. The Three Rivers Heritage Trail extends three miles (5 km) up the north side of the Allegheny River to Millvale, and also three miles (5 km) down the north bank of the Ohio River to Brunot Island. On the Monongahela River, the trail goes five miles (8 km) upriver from Station Square to a point just short of the Waterfront Shopping District.Within the city, the trail takes the names of neighborhoods through which it passes. The north bank of the Allegheny River is Pittsburgh's North Side also known as Northside, and the trail is referred to locally as the 'North Shore Trail'.  On the north bank of the Ohio River, the trail is called the 'Chateau Trail' after the neighborhood along which it runs.  On the south bank of the Allegheny, it goes through the food market area and is called the 'Strip District Trail'.[3]On Monongahela River's north bank, it is called the 'Eliza Furnace Trail' because it passes the site where the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company once had its Eliza Furnaces. Some people call this section the 'Jail Trail' because it also passes the Allegheny County Jail on its way to Oakland, the university center of the city. A branch that extends into Schenley Park in Oakland is called the 'Junction Hollow Trail'. As it moves further up the Monongahela River towards Frick Park, it is called the 'Duck Hollow Trail', because that is where a stream exits the park into the Monongahela. On the south bank of the Monongahela in Pittsburgh's South Side, it is called the 'South Side Trail'.The trail hosts public art and has 61 interpretive signs along the trail, highlighting the region's heritage and riverfront ecology.Pittsburgh is one terminus of the 335-mile (539 km) long 'Great Allegheny Passage' (GAP)[4] that connects the city to Cumberland, Maryland and Washington, D.C. The route of the GAP uses five miles (8 km) of the 'Three Rivers Heritage Trail'. Within the city, the GAP goes from the Waterfront Mall and Sandcastle upstream on the Monongahela River, and then at the SouthSide Works crosses the river on the Hot Metal Bridge. Finally, it uses the north bank of the Monongahela to reach the Pittsburgh Point.The 'Friends of the Riverfront'[2] have also developed and administer the 'Three Rivers Water Trail',[5] along the riverfronts of Allegheny County, for kayakers and canoeists, with access points, parking areas, and boat racks. For many years, the trail hosted the annual 'Pittsburgh Triathlon',[6] a competition for top athletes who use the land and water routes to bike, run, and swim for this Olympic qualifier. A less demanding version is the 'Adventure Race',[7] for friends, families, and teams who wish to paddle, bike, and run a shorter yet challenging course.See also[edit]Friends of the RiverfrontGreat Allegheny PassageChesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical ParkErie to Pittsburgh TrailMontour TrailOhio River TrailSteel Valley TrailYoughiogheny River TrailList of rail trailsReferences[edit]Wikimedia Commons has media related to Three Rivers Heritage Trail.^ ""Heritage Trail"".

32	33	Schenley Plaza	"Coordinates: 40°26′34″N 79°57′09″W﻿ / ﻿40.442672°N 79.952567°W﻿ / 40.442672; -79.952567Schenley Plaza is a public park serving as the grand entrance into Schenley Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[1]The 4.5-acre (18,000 m2) plaza, located on Forbes Avenue and Schenley Drive in the city's Oakland district, includes multiple gardens, food kiosks, public meeting spaces, a carousel, and a prominent 1.0-acre (4,000 m2) ""Emerald Lawn"" with free wireless internet access. The plaza is the site of the Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain, the Christopher Lyman Magee Memorial, the University of Pittsburgh's Frick Fine Arts Building, and formerly the Stephen Foster sculpture.[2] The plaza is also surrounded by many prominent landmarks, including the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning, Stephen Foster Memorial, Hillman Library, and Posvar Hall as well as the Carnegie Institute and its Dippy sculpture.Contents1 History2 Plaza renovation3 References4 External linksHistory[edit]The site of Schenley Plaza was originally a deep gully which was called St. Pierre Hollow as it was near the end of St. Pierre Street (now Bigelow Boulevard).[3] In 1898, a stone arch bridge called the Bellefield Bridge was built over the hollow, which together with the Schenley Bridge provided an entrance into Schenley Park from Forbes Avenue.[4]Eventually, sentiment arose that Bellefield Bridge was not a sufficiently impressive park entrance. Also, in 1911, a place was being sought for a monument to Mary Schenley, patroness of the park. The idea grew that a great public square, both for the memorial and the park entrance, was needed. A national competition elicited 45 proposals for the site, and in June 1915, judges selected the plan of Horace Wells Sellers and H. Bartol Register, both of Philadelphia. According to the judges, the winning design afforded ""the simplest and least confusing plan of driveways; the circulation is good; and provision is made for automobile parking space.""[5] It was one of only two entries to provide parking as this was not mentioned in the brief for the competition.[4] Schenley Plaza, at lower left, as it appeared c. 1923Between 1913 and 1914 St. Pierre Hollow was filled in.[6]  The fill has been popularly said to be earth removed from Downtown's infamous ""Hump"" on Grant Street, but the supporting historical information for this story is disputed.[7] The Bellefield Bridge remains buried here and supports some of the weight of the Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain, which was dedicated in 1918.The plaza was built in 1921 with some modifications from Sellers and Register's winning design. It consisted of a wide driveway running from Forbes Avenue to the Schenley Bridge around a central oval, with grassy areas on either side planted with rows of London plane trees. The Schenley Fountain  stood at the far end. Some planned elements, including a pair of ornamental gateposts, were not built.[4]By the 1930s, the plaza was starting to be used primarily as a parking area to accommodate demand from both university students and fans at Forbes Field, then home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers, which stood on the west side of the plaza. In 1990, the city removed the central oval from the plaza to accommodate more cars, effectively turning it fully into a parking lot.[4]Plaza renovation[edit]From 2004–2006 the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh oversaw a major renovation of the plaza, funded in part by the Oakland Investment Committee, restoring it as a grand entrance to the park. It now offers green space: a 1-acre (4,000 m2) lawn, ever-changing ornamental gardens, and landscaping featuring plants native to Western Pennsylvania. Other features include benches, public programming, food kiosks, amenities such as free wireless service for computers, and a Victorian-style carousel as a featured family attraction. In 2009, the Schenley Plaza renovation won the Silver Award in the Environmentally Sustainable Project category at the 2009 International Awards for Livable Communities held in the Czech Republic city of Plzeň.[8]Schenley Plaza is operated by the non-profit Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy and is maintained in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Parks & Recreation (CitiParks) and Department of Public Works.  It is open dawn to dusk. View from the southwest corner of Schenley Plaza. The University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning, Stephen Foster Memorial, and Heinz Chapel can be seen on the left.

Although of museum caliber, 29 of the 31 rooms are used as daily classrooms by University of Pittsburgh faculty and students, while the other two (the Early American and Syrian-Lebanon) are display rooms viewed through glass doors, utilized primarily for special events, and can only be explored via special guided tour. The Nationality Rooms also serve in a vigorous program of intercultural involvement and exchange in which the original organizing committees for the rooms remain as participants and which includes a program of annual student scholarship to facilitate study abroad.[6] In addition, the Nationality Rooms inspire lectures, seminars, concerts exhibitions, and social events which focus on the various heritages and traditions of the nations represented.  The national, traditional, and religious holidays of the nations represented are celebrated on campus and the rooms are appropriately decorated to reflect these occasions. The Nationality Rooms are available daily for public tours as long as the particular room is not being used for a class or other university function.[7]	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_Rooms
